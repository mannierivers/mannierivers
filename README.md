# I build the engines and the stories that power them.

I am a **Digital Systems & Media Architect** specializing in high-velocity builds for communities and high-stakes brands. I bridge the gap between full-stack engineering and professional media production.

### 🌑 The Night Shift
Based in Arizona (MST), I provide white-label agencies with an **overnight production bridge**. I handle the complex logic, Next.js features, and media assets while your team is offline, delivering finished PRs by your morning stand-up.
